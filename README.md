# Todo App

This is a simple todo app. You can add todos, mark them complete or delete them. The todos are stored in the local storage of your browser so after reloading the page you are still able to access your todos.

The page is hosted via Github pages and can be accessed under [this link](https://sensino-seb.github.io/todo-app/)
